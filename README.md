# TictactoeMarvel

This is an webpage in which you can play tic-tac-toe.

Both players choose a Marvel character by name, their images will appear on the scoreboard and then you can start playing. (Data provided by Marvel. Â© 2014 Marvel)

It has animations when scores go up and when you make a move on the board; it even features an autocomplete in the character selection! Very fancy!

## Layout

This webpage has some components in the following layout:

* App
   * Game

      responsible for managing the child component's events, choosing players turn order, waiting for characters to be selected to allow plays on the board, and allowing the user to reset the board.

      * CharacterSelection

         where players input a characters name and it's data CharacterService. Outputs events when characters are selected, with info about them and which player chose.

      * GameScore
          * PlayerScore

         characters (with images) and scores are displayed

      * TictactoeBoard
